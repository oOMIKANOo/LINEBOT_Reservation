# Note
I decided to create an appointment system for my parents' dental clinic, and started working on this system. When I created just the reservation function, I showed it to my parents, but found that they did not need it, so I stopped developing it. Making an appointment at a dentist's office requires a high level of skill, such as guessing the patient's medical condition based on the patient's story, and is completely different from making an appointment at a beauty salon, so this system cannot be put to practical use.
However, since I made it halfway through, I decided to keep it on github for future use. Through this work, I was able to understand how difficult it is to create a practical base system and how to create LINEBOT to some extent.
